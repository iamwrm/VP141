\section{Measurement Procedure}
\subsection{Spring constant}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Adjust the Jolly balance to vertical and attach the spring Add a 20g preload and adjust knob $I_1$ and $I_2$ to make sure the mirror can move freely through the tube. Check if the balance parallel to the spring.
        \item Adjust knob $G$ to make the three lines in the tube coincide.
        \item Reading the reading on the scale, add mass from 1 to 6 and record $L_i$ in order.
        \item Estimate the spring constant $k_1$ by fitting.
        \item Repeat the measurements with spring 2. Calculate $k_2$.
        \item Remove the preload and repeat the measurements for spring 1 and 2 connected. Calculate $k_3$.
    \end{enumerate}
\subsection{Oscillation period $T$ versus the mass of the oscillator $M$}
    \begin{enumerate}[(a)]
        \item Adjust the air track so that it's horizontal.
            \begin{enumerate}[1.]
                \item Turn on the air track and check whether there's blocked holes.
                \item Place the cart on the track. Adjust the track with the knob on the side with a single one.
            \end{enumerate}
        \item Horizontal air track
            \begin{enumerate}[1.]
                \item Attach springs to the sides of the cart and set up the I-shape shutter. Make sure that the photoelectric gate is at the equilibrium position.
                \item Set the timer into "T" mode. Add weight in order and release it with a caliper. Record the correspoding time intervals for 10 periods.
                \item Analyze the relation between $M$ and $T$ by plotting a graph.
            \end{enumerate}
        \item Inclined air track
            \begin{enumerate}[1.]
                \item Add three plastic plates under the air track everytime. Repeat the steps in (b).
                \item Analyze the relation between $M$ and $T$ by plotting a graph.
            \end{enumerate}
    \end{enumerate}
    
\subsection{The maximum speed versus the amplitude}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Keep the mass of the cart unchanged and change the amplitude from $5.0 to 30.0 cm$ with gap of $5.0cm$.
        \item Measure $v_{max}$ for different amplitudes.
    \end{enumerate}

\subsection{Mass measurement}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Adjust the electronic balance every time before you use it. The level bubble should be in the center of the circle.
        \item Add weights according to a fixed order. Weigh the cart with the I-shape shutter and with the U-shape shutter. Measure the mass of spring 1 and spring 2.
        \item Record the data only after the circular symbol on the scales display disappears.
    \end{enumerate}
