\section{Experimental setup}
    This exercise requires a Stokes' viscosity measurement device (see Figure \ref{apparatus}) with castor oil and some small metal balls. The experiment also requires devices including micrometer, calliper, densimeter, electronic scales, stopwatch, and thermometer.

    The micrometer is used to measure the diameters of the balls, allowing measurements with maximum uncertainty of $0.004mm$. The calliper is used to measure the inner diameter of the flask, whose maximum uncertainty is $0.02mm$.The densimeter's maximum uncertainty is $0.001 g/cm^3$. The electronic scales' maximum uncertainty is $0.001g$. The stopwatch's maximum uncertainty is $0.01s$. The thermometer's maximum uncertainty is $\SI{2}{\degreeCelsius}$.\\
