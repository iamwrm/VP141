We use 40 balls to calculate the average mass of the ball.
For each ball's mass is quite small and very hard to measure due to the uncertainty of equipment.
We choose 40 instead of 10 to maintain 4 significant numbers.

Actually T has influence on $\mu$. The higher temperature is , the more likely the molecule will move, making the viscosity lowerf.
