\section{Introduction}
Fluid viscosity is one of the most important properties of fluids, determining the fluid’s flow.
Motion of an object in a fluid is hindered by a drag force acting in the direction opposite to the direction of motion, i.e. opposite to the object’s velocity. 
The magnitude of the drag force is related to the shape and speed of the object as well as to the internal friction in the fluid.
The method used in this lab is known as Stokes’ method and it a common and simple method for characterizing transparent or translucent fluids with high viscosity.
