\section{Introduction}

The objective of the exercise is to study several methods of measuring the
speed of sound in air: the resonance method, the phase comparison method, and
the time difference method, including successive difference method in
measurement data processing.
    
Sound is a mechanical wave that propagates through a compressible medium.
It's a longitudinal wave since the direction of vibrations of the medium is
the same as the direction of propagation. Sound with the frequency higher
than $20,000\ Hz$ is called \emph{ultrasound}, which is chosen as the signal
source in this experiment because its wavelength is short enough to measure
the speed precisely.
    
The phase speed $v$, the frequency $f$ and the length $\lambda$ of a wave are
related by the formula 
\begin{equation}\label{vlf}
    v=\lambda f.
\end{equation}

For motion with constant speed $v$ along a straight line, we have 
\begin{equation}\label{vlt}
    v=\frac{L}{t},
\end{equation}
where $L$ is the distance travelled over time $t$.
