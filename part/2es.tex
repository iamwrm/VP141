\section{Experimental Setup}

The measurement equipment consists of the following elements: springs, Jolly
balance, air track, electronic timer, electronic balance and masses.

In order to measure the spring constant using the Jolly balance, we need to
place the small mirror $C$ (see Figure~\ref{jb}) in the tube $D$ and make
three lines coincide: the line on the mirror, the line on the glass tube and its
reflection in the mirror. First, without adding any weight on the bottom end of
the spring, adjust the knob G and make the three lines coincide. Then read the
scale $L_1$. 
    
Second, add mass m to the bottom of the spring. The spring is stretched and the
three lines no longer coincide. Adjust knob G to make them into one line again
and read the corresponding number on scale $L_2$. The spring constant may be
then found as 

\begin{equation}
k=\frac{mg}{L_2-L_1}
\end{equation}

so that we can estimate the spring constant by finding a linear fit to the data
using the least squares method.

A photoelectric measuring system consists of two photoelectric gates and an
electronic timer. When a shutter on the object blocks the light, the computer
will record the time. For period measurements, we use the I-shape shutter. 

When measuring the instantaneous speed, the U-shape shutter is required. $\Delta t$
presents the time interval when the object travels a distance of $\Delta
x=(x_{in}+x_{out})/2$. Hence we estimate the speed as $v=\Delta x/\Delta t$.
